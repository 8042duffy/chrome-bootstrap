Chrome UI bootstrap
================

Chrome's UI stylings look pretty nice and are advancing quickly. In order to make top quanlity extensions, apps, and one offs that look and feel like Chrome's system apps, these styles must be exposed for easy reuse.

This project aims at accomplishing this goal of reuse while keeping the scope extremely simple.

The Scope
----------------

* Reusable styles
* CSS animations
* I18n'ed properties (-webkit-margin-start instead of margin-left for example)

And that's it. Let's keep it simple!

*Accepting pull requests!*
