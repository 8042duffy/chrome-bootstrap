Chrome UI bootstrap
================

Chrome's UI stylings look pretty nice and are advancing quickly. In order to make top quanlity extensions, apps, and other offs that look and feel like Chrome's system apps, these styles must be exposed for easy reuse.

This project aims at accomplishing this goal while keeping the scope extremely simple.

Scope
----------------

* Reusable selectors
* CSS animations
* I18n'ed properties

And that's it. Let's keep it simple! *Accepting pull requests*
